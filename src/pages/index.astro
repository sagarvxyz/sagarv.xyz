                    >I'm a software engineer specializing in data and analytics.</strong
                > I've been an analyst, marketer, and engineer. I've worked in CPG,
                B2B SaaS, and entertainment. I've been the tenth employee, and the
                ten-thousandth. Today â€” I'm building data models, pipelines, and
                custom data viz apps at Netflix.

                Outside of work, I find myself learning... for fun! I'm usually
                reading, tinkering, or making time for some new project or
                hobby. I get a kick out of variety and prefer the full quote,

                <q
                    >A jack of all trades is a master of none, <strong
                        >but oftentimes better than a master of one</strong
                    >.</q
